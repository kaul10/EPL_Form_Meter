        <ul>
         <li> Created a visualization in D3 to view the form of all the teams in the Barclay's Premier League for the seasons 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015</li>
<li> The visualization shares a multi series line chart where each line is used to represent a different team</li>
<li> The spikes in the line chart indicate the position of the team at the end of each game week among the twenty contenders</li>
<li> The user can use the position of the teams after each gameweek or for a certain month to visualize the form and how the team fared over the entire season</li>
<li> In order to track the performance of a single team the user can hover over the line chart of desired team to view the performance after each match in the selected season</li>
<li> On clicking the legend of the selected team we can add/remove the team form line from the visualization and can consider the teams that have their forms represented by darker lines</li>
<li>A slider box is provided at the bottom to allow brushing in order to enable users to dive deeper into the details and perform analysis for a shorter duration</li>
<li>The club emblems are given at the top of the page which change as per the season, replacing the three relegated teams with newly promoted teams from the championships</li>
<li>The club emblems are also linked to the official websites of the teams allowing the user to research more about a specific team in detail</li>
<li>On hovering over the line, the line darkens hence giving us a better view of the form and a tooltip shows up that provides us with the name of the team, month and the year of that instance on the line graph</li>

<li> Created a map for the city of NYC showing the five boroughs</li>
<li> Implemented the zoom and drag feature on the map to enable the user to zoom into a specific borough or drag a specific borough into the view</li>
<li> Created two bubble charts to show the change in population in each borough</li>
<li> The two bubble charts increase/decrease in size with the increase/decrease in population which is in turn controlled by the slider</li>
<li> Implemented color encoding to ensure that the user finds it easy to relate the boroughs on the map to the appropriate bubbles on the bubble charts</li>
<li> Created a Tableau dashboard to support above concept of increase in obese and total population in New York City from 2008 to 2040</li>
<li> Created a Tableau dashboard to show the 10 major causes of death in the United States wherein four of these diseases were more likely to be caused by obesity</li></ul>

<li>Through the drop down menu the user can further study the effectiveness of each antibiotic on the different bacteria</li>
<li>Through the use of a logarithmic scale we can see the MIC value of each antibiotic required to treat the different bacteria</li>
